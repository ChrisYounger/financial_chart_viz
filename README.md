# Financial Chart Viz powered by TradingView

Configurable candlestick (OHLC) chart with volume data. Supports mouse pan/zoom, dynamic markers and dark mode.  Uses the TradingView lightweight charting library. This viz is useful for displaying financial data such as stocks and equity prices. Note that this is just a visualization for displaying data you have in Splunk already, it does not retreive price quotes from the internet. Splunkbase has a few apps that can do this.
